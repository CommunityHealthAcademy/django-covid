    <ol>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Content Submission</span>: Reputable organizations submit, tag and summarize their content to
        COVID-19 Library, confirming that it meets the COVID-19 Library criteria (https://covid19library.org/resource/guidelines/). Upon
        submission, the Community Health Academy staff receive an alert that new content is available for review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Initial review</span>: Community Health Academy staff conduct an initial review to ensure that the submitted
        content is appropriate for frontline health workers and appears to meet the COVID-19 Library criteria. If it is, then
        Community Health Academy assigns the content to the appropriate CRT members for review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">External review</span>: The assigned medical, technology and training experts from the CRT
        reviews the content to ensure the materials meet the standards for their area of expertise as well as the COVID-19 Library
        quality standards. If the resource does not meet one of the criteria, then the reviewer provides an explanation.
        The reviewer can then accept or reject the resource for inclusion into COVID-19 Library and notifies Community Health Academy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Approval</span>: Community Health Academy staff makes approved content available on COVID-19 Library.
      </li>

      If a resource has been rejected by one or more reviewers, Community Health Academy staff will share a summary of the
      feedback/explanation to and liaise with the content submitter to discuss the decision.
