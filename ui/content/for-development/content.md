<h2>How to use COVID-19 Library</h2>

<h3>Finding Resources on COVID-19 Library</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 Library platform provides several methods to help find the right content for you - <a href="/">browsing</a>, <a href="/search/">searching</a> and
    <a href="">filtering</a>.</p>

<p>All the resources are free to access. Registration is not required, but it does allow you to bookmark, rate, and contribute resources. Every resource on COVID-19 Library is openly
    licensed, however some have restrictions on creating adaptations or translations. When you're using the resources, and especially if you're adapting them, remember to
    keep within the terms of the license and include attribution to the author. </p>

<h3>Using Resources on COVID-19 Library</h3>

<p>Once you've found the resources you're looking for, each resource will have at least one download or web link option. Use these to save the resource onto your laptop or
    mobile device. You can use the resources for your own study or integrate them into a  training program or workshop.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for how you could use the content in your training program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the videos onto SD cards, to distribute to health workers to watch on their mobile devices</li>
<li>Integrate the resources into a mobile learning or eLearning training courses</li>
<li>Use as teaching aids in classroom or in-person courses</li>
<li>Use the videos with community members to help reinforce health messages (for example about handwashing, or breastfeeding)</li>
</ul>
