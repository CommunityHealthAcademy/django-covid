This category addresses content collected in support of a RCCE plan. Details of the planning process can be found within the WHO [RCCE Action Plan Guidance](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/risk-communication-and-community-engagement-(rcce)-action-plan-guidance).

What is relevant to the Covid-19 Library is the collection of IEC materials that support the planning process. Materials that fall within this category provide relevant information, education and communication (IEC) materials tailored for and pre-tested with representatives of audiences for whom they are intended. Pre-testing messages and materials with target audiences ensures that messages are context specific and increases ownership from communities and at-risk populations and other stakeholders.

As much as possible IEC materials should contain actions that people can take:

1. an instruction to follow
2. a behaviour to adopt
3. information you can share with friends and family
