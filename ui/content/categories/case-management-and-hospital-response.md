This category is intended for content that supports clinicians taking care of hospitalised adult and paediatric patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when a nCoV infection is suspected. It should provide information that strengthens clinical management of these patients and provide up-to-date guidance. Best practices for SARI including IPC and optimized supportive care for severely ill patients are essential.
